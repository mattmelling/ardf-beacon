Simple morse code beacon for an amateur radio direction finding exercise.

CW tone is generated using PWM on pin 3 of an Arduino Nano, while pin 4 is used to assert PTT which can be used to drive a transistor that takes the PTT pin of a Baofeng UV-5R to ground. The PWM can be fed straight in to the Baofeng's mic.
